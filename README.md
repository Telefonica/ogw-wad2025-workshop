# WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2025
## Workshop: "Integrating Open Gateway in your application to shift to a better sign-up experience"

## Overview
In this workshop, we will explore how to integrate Open Gateway into your application to enhance a secure sign-up experience. Open Gateway provides a standardized way to manage user identities and streamline the authentication process.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of web development and APIs.
- Familiarity with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect concepts.
- A development environment set up with Node.js and npm.
- A Vonage account.

## Objectives
You will start by testing an existing application implementing a regular sign-up flow, with verification links via email or OTP codes via SMS as two factor authentication. Then, you will learn how to integrate Open Gateway into your application to improve the sign-up experience by getting rid of emails and SMSs. By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:
- Understand the benefits of using Open Gateway for user authentication.
- Implement Open Gateway in your application.
- Enhance the user sign-up experience by reducing friction and improving security.
